# creativity
Creativity is what drives us and our societies forward, so lets be creative. 

This is my first "own" try of a website, I got a lot of ideas, And ill keep on fixing and trying out stuff on this one.

So this was my first school project at the Front end education at KYH Stockholm. 

I got this one on my school Github and decided to move it over to my own personal git.
This profile was created during my 5 week web developement beginner course i took in june 2020 at Jensens education. 

The first project at KYH Front End had to include HTML, CSS and JS. 
A navbar with 3 "links" some pictures, html, css and js
In the JS we had to have a form validation of somekind

and some media queries for use on desktop mobile and pads

So from here on Ill use this git to add my projects I learn and do during my time as a frond end developer student and forward.
